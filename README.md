# RainingBlocks

Arcade puzzle game with falling tetromino blocks.

Blocks fall on a set timer, and game over occurs when blocks stack to the top of the screen.

Blocks can be cleared by completing a horizontal row, at which point the complete row will disappear. Blocks above a
completed row will drop down one row.
